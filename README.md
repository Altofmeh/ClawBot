Reflection:
Our project and the making of it went pretty good. In the end it all worked out and the robot did its job perfectly. We did, have a few problems while making the robot. One of the main problems was that half way through the building we discovered that we were using the wrong spacers for the area to lock the gear in. We had to take apart that whole section so that we could replace the spacers to the right ones. The wheels also started becoming less efficient as they were getting slow because we used the wrong screw and gear. We were eventually able to fix the screw and the wheels worked properly again.
